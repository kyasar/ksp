2
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,798
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen,

3
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,871
but I found the best thing to do
with the new employee

4
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:51,992
is to size them up
with a long hard stare.

5
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,058
- So!
- So.

6
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,382
- First day!
- Yes!

7
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,837
- Scary...?
- Yes...

8
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,144
- Don't be scared!
- Oh I'm not really scared.

9
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:16,735
You should be!

10
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,854
- Well I'm a little bit scared.
- What? Don't be!

11
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,943
Make up your mind!

12
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:21,893
So here you are!

13
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:23,363
Yes.

14
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,281
I'm... really looking forward to...

15
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,852
- getting to grips with the...
- I'm gonna put you in I.T.

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,223
Because you said on your CV you had
a lot of experience with computers.

17
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:35,579
I did say that on my CV yes.

18
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:38,703
I have lots of experience
with the whole...

19
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:42,413
computer... thing you know, e-mails...

20
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:47,424
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails,
deleting e-mails...

21
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,863
- ... I could go on.
- Do!

22
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:56,154
The Web... Using mouse...
mices... using mice.

23
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,835
Clicking... double clicking...

24
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:03,222
the computer screen of course,
the keyboard...

25
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,541
the...bit that goes on the floor
down there...

26
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,062
- The hard drive?
- Correct.

27
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,768
Well, you certainly seem
to know your stuff.

28
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,613
That settles.
Got a good feeling about you Jen!

29
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,329
And they need a new manager.

30
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:15,354
Oh fantastic!

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,645
So... the people I'll be working with,
what're they like?

32
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,253
Standard nerds!

33
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,525
Hello I.T.?

34
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,135
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

35
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,127
OK, well, the button on the side,
is it glowing?

36
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:20,779
Yeah, you need to turn it on!

37
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:24,939
The button, turns it on?!

38
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,198
Yeah... You... Yeah...

39
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,308
You do know how a button works,
don't you?

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,005
No, not on clothes!

41
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,158
Hello, I.T.?

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,176
Yeah?

43
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,512
Have you tried forcing
an unexpected reboot?

44
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:45,156
No, no! There you go! No there you go,
I just heard it come on.

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,080
No no, that's the music you hear
when it comes on.

46
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,757
No, that's the music you hear when...

47
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:52,181
I'm sorry, are you from the past?!

48
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:56,416
See the driver hooks a function
by patching the system call table.

49
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,758
So it's not safe to unload it,

50
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,403
unless another thread's about
to jump in there and do its stuff.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,557
... and you don't want to end up
in middle of invalid memory.

52
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:06,831
Hello?

53
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:11,439
Oh really? Really, why don't you come
down here and make me then?

54
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:14,355
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!

55
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,009
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for ya!

56
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:19,574
That told her!

57
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:24,769
Oh God, it's about time you got back,
it's been all go.

58
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:25,672
You had a job?

59
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,431
Girl on fifth...

60
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,484
Did you and her... hit it off?

61
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,118
Define "hit it off"?

62
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,128
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

63
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:38,337
No...

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:42,972
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

65
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,734
- No?!
- Yep!

66
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,072
Unbelievable!

67
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,105
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us
up there, no respect whatsoever!

68
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,884
We're all just drudgens to them.

69
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:52,668
Yes!

70
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,694
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

71
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:56,233
that is what we'd be to them.

72
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,367
It's like they're pally-wally

73
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:59,009
when there's a problem
with their printer

74
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:00,306
but once it's fixed...

75
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,007
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

76
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:03,417
Yes!

77
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:07,322
Yesterday's jam!
That is what we are to them!

78
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,055
Actually you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing...

79
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,454
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

80
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:16,980
Hello, I.T. ?

81
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,107
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

82
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:26,546
Unisex toilets? You have unisex toilets,
like Ally McBeal?

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,496
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

84
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:37,854
A lot of sexy people not doing
much work... and having affairs.

85
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,494
Oh my God! Look at that view!

86
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,725
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

87
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:51,503
Well  Jen, this is where I leave you.

88
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,081
<i>Floor 34.</i>

89
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:57,244
Great sir, thank you.
OK. Where am I going?

90
00:05:57,263 --> 00:06:00,097
All... the way down to the basement.

91
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,911
Good luck!

92
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,669
<i>Get out of the lift...</i>

93
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:42,465
- Oh. Won't be a tick!
- Oh my God!

94
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:46,128
Oh my God! Oh God! OK.

95
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,765
Hello?

96
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,229
Hello?

97
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:45,617
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

98
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,184
I'm sorry, myself and Morris
were just engaged

99
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,766
in quite a serious discussion
about books and such.

100
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,646
We didn't hear you come in.

101
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,807
Wait a second, you said it was
Tolstoy, he said what?

102
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,666
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

103
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,446
When have you read Tolstoy?

104
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:01,907
Shut up, Morris!

105
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,636
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

106
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,410
When did... I don't remember
this conversation at all!

107
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:11,644
Don't... don't let me disturb you,
I just wanted to come down....

108
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:14,228
Don't be silly you never dist...

109
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:23,051
Many people come down here to visit!

110
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,944
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

111
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,653
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?!

112
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,168
So... What can we do you for?

113
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,319
I'm the new head of this department.

114
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:45,095
Is this my office?

115
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:49,240
Why? What did she... Did she just say...


116
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:52,448
- I am the head of this department!
- I thought I was.

117
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:56,472
It's  one of us! Certainly not her!
I'm gonna sort this out...

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,024
Roy! You've got a head wound there...
Head wound!

119
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,623
Hi!

120
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,635
I don't wanna be rude or anything

121
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,065
but I wasn't informed of any changes
to this department.

122
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,205
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

123
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:09,838
N o!

124
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:13,395
And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much,

125
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,817
we're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

126
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:16,844
Sure... sure...

127
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,453
You know you're covered in blood?

128
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:20,933
Moss!

129
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,000
Amazon thingy.

130
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,462
Ah! Wicked!

131
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,094
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

132
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:30,059
I got the child edition
and the adult edition

133
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:33,184
just to check that there are
no differences in the text.

134
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,377
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able
to deal with that woman!

135
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,488
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!

136
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,216
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.

137
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:51,572
Come in!

138
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:55,315
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

139
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:59,132
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

140
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,088
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

141
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,998
Yeah, I know.

142
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:07,134
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

143
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,641
Ok!

144
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,953
Ok, take care, take care!

145
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,623
Ok bye! Bye!

146
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,683
Oh, so, hello!

147
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:20,149
What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

148
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,871
Hello. I was just wondering...

149
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:25,640
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

150
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,188
No no no... No.

151
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,086
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.

152
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,548
But how?!

153
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:45,756
Oh do you mind... Do you mind
closing the door for me?

154
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:48,109
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Yeah, Ok.

155
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,988
Yeah. From the other side...

156
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:53,839
Of course.

157
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,072
- Like this?
- That's it!

158
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,842
- With me on the...
- Thanks!

159
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,513
Are you all right?

160
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:16,962
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

161
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,788
The nurse said I didn't do myself
any serious damage.

162
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,027
I'm standing over here!

163
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,564
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

164
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:24,791
What we gonna do about her?

165
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:28,679
Well, I just went in, and she was having
a pretend conversation.

166
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,235
- Really?
- Yes.

167
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,812
She's a little bit weird...
to say the least.

168
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:35,992
What's that?

169
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,370
Oh just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

170
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,839
and this helps cool it down.

171
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:42,953
She is quite the oddbod...

172
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,867
Did you notice how
she didn't even get excited

173
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,720
when she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

174
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,669
Yeah, that was weird.

175
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:52,072
It's almost as if she doesn't know
anything about computers.

176
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,917
What?!

177
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,515
Look what you did!

178
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,038
Oh don't worry that's why
I always make 2 cups of tea.

179
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,720
Anyway, what were we talking about?

180
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,691
Oh, her not knowing anything
about computers.

181
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:03,434
What?!

182
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:10,726
"Dear sir, stroke, madam."

183
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,858
"Fire!" Exclamation mark.

184
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,789
"Fire!" Exclamation mark.

185
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,229
"Help me!" Exclamation mark.

186
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,584
"123, Carendon Road."

187
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,139
"Looking forward to hearing from you!"

188
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:25,531
"All the best, Morris Moss."

189
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,655
<i>The IT Crowd continues next!</i>

190
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:34,596
<i>I definitely want to get rid of her.</i>

191
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:36,026
I agree yeah.

192
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,242
Ok, so, here's the plan:

193
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:42,458
A plan? Let me put on
my slightly larger glasses.

194
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,901
Ok, hit me!

195
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,255
- Ok. We go in...
- When?

196
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:54,079
You know, like in a minute.

197
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:56,402
Will that be enough time for me
to get to know the plan?

198
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,039
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!

199
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,223
I... I've clearly gotten you
over-excited!

200
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:04,131
Would "steamed" be a better word?

201
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:07,189
Although that's just as exciting,
I might even use these.

202
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,173
All I was gonna say was...

203
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:17,697
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks
about computers

204
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:19,184
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

205
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:25,046
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

206
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,368
Let me do the talk.

207
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:28,040
All right.

208
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:30,999
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

209
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:33,736
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

210
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,991
We... we need to stay calm.

211
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,535
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

212
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,157
Hang on, guys.

213
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,022
How can I help?

214
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,863
Well, we were just wondering
now that you're "The Boss",

215
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,147
would you like us to access
the data supplier

216
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,538
and connect you up to the matrix?

217
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,068
You just made all that up?

218
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,588
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

219
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,649
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there,

220
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:17,460
and do some work, to do with computers!

221
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:20,626
I'll be in there in a minute
and check up on you!

222
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,951
Ok, lady!

223
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:26,352
You've won this round, but we can wait!

224
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,596
You will slip up one day,

225
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,119
and believe you me,
we will be there when you do!

226
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,160
There will be some piece of evidence
that will prove

227
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,307
without  any shadow of a doubt

228
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,160
that you don't know
anything about computers.

229
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,334
What are you doing?

230
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,221
Plugging in your computer.

231
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,680
It might be something you say...

232
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,299
or something you do!

233
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,310
But when we notice this,
and believe me we will notice this,

234
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,912
there's gonna be a long way down
for you, sweet chicks!

235
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,815
He'll realise in a second...

236
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:11,098
I cannot believe you're going
to tell on me.

237
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:14,718
You're like a pair of horrible
old women.

238
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,223
What did she say?

239
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,843
She said we're like horrible old women.

240
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,127
She didn't!

241
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,009
Hey guys!

242
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:23,485
Ok, got something to tell me?

243
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,181
Yes, well, it's like this:

244
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,649
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

245
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,028
- Yeah.
- Team players each and every one of you.

246
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,038
Yeah, what she...

247
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:33,570
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team!

248
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,112
Excuse me.

249
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,464
Hello?

250
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:37,772
What?!

251
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:40,517
Well if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired!

252
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,281
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!

253
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,013
Hello, Security?

254
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,126
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

255
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:49,873
Escort them from the premises.

256
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:50,997
And do it as a team!

257
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,013
Remember you're a team, and if you can't
act as a team, you're fired too!

258
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,175
Dawn!

259
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:59,005
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team

260
00:15:59,006 --> 00:15:59,986
that can work as team.

261
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,869
They may have to escort our
security team from the building,

262
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,173
for not acting like a team!

263
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:10,233
Team! Team team team team team!

264
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,294
I even love saying the word "team".

265
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,489
You probably think that's a picture
of my family?

266
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:18,430
It's the A-Team.

267
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:23,196
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

268
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,753
All of them!

269
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,596
So what do you wanna tell me?

270
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,218
Well, it's just not working out.

271
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:33,065
- He's joking!
- But you said...

272
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,172
Not working out?

273
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,902
Oh no! No!

274
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,334
We are getting on like
a big house on fire!

275
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,188
- Yeah!
- My ear's getting hot!

276
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,008
No... You know what?
We should leave, now, because

277
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:46,461
you know, you're a busy man

278
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,491
and we've taken far too much
of your time.

279
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,308
Jen could you just get the door
for me there?

280
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,360
Absolutely Roy!

281
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,125
So why did you come here
in the first place?

282
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:59,620
We set up a voice activation system
on your computer.

283
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,209
I  think you're gonna enjoy it.

284
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,955
It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice

285
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,106
but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!

286
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,202
- Bye bye!
- Thank you!

287
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,658
How exciting!

288
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,169
Hello...

289
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:17,742
Hello computer!

290
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,843
Hello!

291
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:27,441
Hello... Hello computer...

292
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:32,135
What good are you?

293
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,757
You obviously don't know anything
about computers.

294
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,158
No but... OK.

295
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,543
But I can learn.

296
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,679
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

297
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,849
you could take me through
what you're doing right now.

298
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,077
I'd be delighted!

299
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:47,249
I'm just working on a very simple piece
of programming code.

300
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,842
I see...

301
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:00,789
Oh God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!

302
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:03,080
I don't know anything
about computers, I mean...

303
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:07,188
I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.

304
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:13,049
Hi! Is... Roy around?

305
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,222
Hello there little lady!

306
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:18,788
Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.

307
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,609
You wanted me to come down?!

308
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:24,772
Well here I am!!

309
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:26,176
Not the face!!

310
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,223
Not the face!!

311
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,747
Well maybe this will teach you

312
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:33,308
to treat people with
a little bit of respect!

313
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,490
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone
earlier?

314
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:41,181
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

315
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:41,843
Yes!

316
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,645
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

317
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,899
No, no no no! Got them in a sale.

318
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,213
Oh God! Clever you!

319
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,147
I'm never lucky enough
to get a bargain myself.

320
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,714
Well, I should take you shopping.

321
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:53,678
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

322
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:56,143
Oh I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you! Take care!

323
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,735
- Nice meeting you!
- Chairman! Wow!

324
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,270
You just diffuse that entire situation!

325
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,566
What situation?

326
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:07,877
Oh oh, that.. yeah!
Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

327
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:11,024
They're fairly regular,
the beatings, yes.

328
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,504
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

329
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:15,235
Ah it's not all that bad!

330
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,969
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

331
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:21,289
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean...

332
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,627
I'm a people person and...

333
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:26,311
people like you need a person
to deal with people...

334
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,996
a people person like me. Oh my God!

335
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:31,883
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!

336
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,946
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

337
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,269
if I told you that I had a plan

338
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:40,320
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?

339
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,325
I can't be done! You're crazy!

340
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,090
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out! Ok!

341
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:49,574
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

342
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:15,918
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY

343
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:24,974
No no! Oh no, really really really,
that was a true story!

344
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,412
Unbelievable!

345
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,495
I said why we don't go out
with the I.T. guys more often?

346
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,821
- You're hilarious!
- Yes we are!

347
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:36,272
You guys should come down here
more often you know,

348
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,977
you should see this as a new era
for Reynholm Industries.

349
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,864
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

350
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,346
Oh Do you know what! If you want
to hear something really funny,

351
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:46,501
a really funny story,

352
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:48,205
you should hear what happened
to Moss and I,

353
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:49,898
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

354
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,838
that Moss lost his glasses!

355
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:54,068
Moss! Moss!

356
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:55,661
Come here! Come here!

357
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,579
Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

358
00:20:58,609 --> 00:20:59,257
Really?

359
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,850
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

360
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,691
Oh this a great story,
you're gonna love it!

361
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,545
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

362
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:07,911
Well go on, then.

363
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:10,818
All right.

364
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,962
- Well, one night, we were really drunk.
- Yeah.

365
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:21,370
And huh, we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

366
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,154
And when they arrived to the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

367
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,936
so we brought them to the fair.

368
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:31,712
Oh really nice! In the end,
they only charged us half.

369
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:33,844
But we did have to pay
for all the rides.

370
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:43,136
Oh isn't that just the best story?

371
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:44,775
Oh, man!

372
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,239
You told me to never tell that story
to anyone.

373
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,512
Well,  what're you talking about?
That's a brilliant story!

374
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,162
And then you nearly walked
into the canal!

375
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,023
Has it got to that part
with the boatman?

376
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:59,821
Do you mean the story
when I lost my glasses?

377
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,856
Yes!

378
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,573
What story did you think I mean?

379
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:13,570
Moss?

380
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:18,352
What did you say?! What did you say?!

381
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,113
It's all right for you two.

382
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:25,605
You're used to being social social piranhas...

383
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:31,946
I'm a very popular person usually.

384
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:36,887
That girl earlier, that tried
to beat me to death with her shoes,

385
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:38,947
did anybody get her number?

386
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:42,398
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

387
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:47,204
With Brandy and Crystal!

388
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:51,850
Hello I.T.?

389
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:56,228
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

390
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,476
Hello ! Hello !
