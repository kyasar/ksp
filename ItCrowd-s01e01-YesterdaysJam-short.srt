
3
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:04,871
but I found the best thing to do
with the new employee

4
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:08,992
is to size them up
with a long hard stare.

5
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:11,058
- So!
- So.

6
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,382
- First day!
- Yes!

7
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:13,837
- Scary...?
- Yes...

8
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,144
- Don't be scared!
- Oh I'm not really scared.

9
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:16,735
You should be!

10
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,854
- Well I'm a little bit scared.
- What? Don't be!

11
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:19,943
Make up your mind!

12
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:21,893
So here you are!

13
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:32,363
Yes.

14
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,281
I'm... really looking forward to...

15
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,852
- getting to grips with the...
- I'm gonna put you in I.T.

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,223
Because you said on your CV you had
a lot of experience with computers.

17
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:35,579
I did say that on my CV yes.

18
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:38,703
I have lots of experience
with the whole...

19
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:42,413
computer... thing you know, e-mails...

20
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:47,424
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails,
deleting e-mails...

21
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,863
- ... I could go on.
- Do!

22
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:56,154
The Web... Using mouse...
mices... using mice.

23
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,835
Clicking... double clicking...

24
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:03,222
the computer screen of course,
the keyboard...

25
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,541
the...bit that goes on the floor
down there...
